 ## OVERVIEW
 - BreakingBad is a simple iOS application built using breakingbadapi.
 - Built in MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Reactive Programming (RXSwift).

### MVVM Architecture

MVVM makes the view controller simpler by moving a lot of business logic out of it.
The view model better expresses the business logic for the view.
A view model is much easier to test than a view controller. You end up testing business logic without having to worry about view implementations.
